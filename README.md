# Crown Clash: AI-Powered Strategy Game  

## Overview  
Crown Clash is a **Python-based strategy game** that combines elements of **checkers and chess**. It features unique movement rules for Soldiers, Queens, and Kings, along with an AI opponent powered by **Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Genetic Algorithms, and Fuzzy Logic**.  

## Features  
- **AI Opponent** – Compete against an AI with multiple difficulty levels.  
- **Advanced Decision-Making** – Uses **Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Genetic Algorithms, and Fuzzy Logic**.  
- **Dynamic Gameplay** – Unique movement and capture rules for Soldiers, Queens, and Kings.  
- **Animated Winner Screen** – Displays dynamic GIFs based on game outcomes.  

## How to Play  
- **Soldiers** move forward one cell and capture opponent pieces.

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** – Core programming language for the game.  
- **Pygame** – Used for game graphics, rendering, and event handling.  
- **NumPy** – Optimized numerical computations and array operations.  
- **Pillow (PIL)** – Image processing and manipulation.  
- **Imageio** – Handling and displaying GIF animations.  
- **AI Algorithms** – Implements **Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, Genetic Algorithm, and Fuzzy Logic** for AI decision-making.
